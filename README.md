# Regex-with-Python

A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

Regular expressions are helpful, but few non-programmers know about 
them even though most modern text editors and word processors, such as 
Microsoft Word or OpenOffice, have find and find-and-replace features 
that can search based on regular expressions. Regular expressions are 
huge time-savers, not just for software users but also for programmers.
